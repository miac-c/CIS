<h1>Mia Contreras-Cordero</h1>
<p>My name is Mia Contreras-Cordero Cordero and I am 24 years old. I am a student at Cerritos College, mom to Ulysses and wife to Marcos.
Fun fact, this is my second class I am taking with Professor Allen! I chose the path to Computer Science because computers
always amazed me and I always wanted to know more of the behind the scenes like coding and programming side. I work at a 
computer repair shop as the Administrative Assistant, besides Administrative stuff I do alot of hands on like minor repairs 
such as screen replacements, diagnostics and battery changes. If all goes well with me and my classes I am set to graduate June 2024! I am 
excited for this journey I been going through , its been a long one but will be worth it in the end.
